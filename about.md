# About

I never had much interest in writing my own blog until I was encouraged to do so by the 'Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch' book by Jeremy Howard and Sylvian Gugger. This is why my first blog post is about my first CNN.

Hopefully I will have more posts to come and this will be of interest to somebody, but if not it shall hopefully at least suffice as a self learning/recall tool for myself.
